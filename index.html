            <h3>Who is Alan Watts?</h3>
            <p>
              A prolific author, speaker, and self styled 'philosophical
              entertainer', Alan Watts was one of the first to interpret Eastern
              wisdom for a Western audience - tasking himself with the near
              impossible, putting that which is unknowable into words. He wrote
              more than 25 books and articles on religion and philosphy. His
              lectures also found posthumous popularity with many now available
              online.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watts didn’t ask for you to follow any creed, or to look to him as
              a guru or any other self-defeating, self-help drivel. He simply
              asked just for you to be. His books and lectures cover a number of
              different topics — a messenger of Zen, Watts bridged the gap of
              understanding between the East and West — and paint a full picture
              of a well-lived life in a whimsically poetic way. One that compels
              you to gaze within yourself and the cosmos around you.

                <h4>The Book on the taboo against knowing who you are</h4>
                <p>
                  Many wonder which Alan Watts book they should read first. A
                  centerpiece in the bibliography of Watts is a piece usually
                  referred to just as The Book. It is here where Watts sets out
                  to discover what he believes to be the fundamental
                  misunderstanding of who we really are. The idea of the “Ego”
                  or self as an isolated being not connected to the rest of the
                  universe has given us a hostile view of the world “outside of
                  ourselves.”

                <p>
                  “How is it possible that a being with such sensitive jewels as
                  the eyes, such enchanted musical instruments as the ears, and
                  such fabulous arabesque of nerves as the brain can experience
                  itself anything less than a god.“

                <h4>Out of your mind</h4>

                <br />
                <p>
                  Drawn from Watt's most notable lectures, this book invites us
                  to delve into his favourite pathways out of the trap of
                  conventional awareness: discover art of the 'controlled
                  accident' - what happens when you stop taking life so
                  seriously and start enjoying it with complete sincerity.
                  Embrace the chaos to discover your deepest purpose and
                  transcending the illusions of the 'the myth of myself'. As
                  Alan Watts himself says 'Sometimes to come to you senses, you
                  have to go out of your mind'.
                </p>
                <h5>Notable Quote</h5>
                <p>
                  “This is the real secret of life-to be completely engaged with
                  what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling
                  it work, realize it is play.”

                  The Joyous Cosmology: Adventures in the chemistry of

                </h4>
                <p>
                  The Joyous Cosmology joins the ranks of some of the best
                  psychedelic books ever written. Continuing the tradition as
                  philosophical seeker and not one just out for recreational fun
                  — Watts saw the true worth of psychedelic exploration. He
                  believed true insight could be found “when accompanied with
                  sustained philosophical reflection by a person who is in
                  search, not of kicks, but of understanding.” This book argues
                  for the protection and right to our own brains and nervous
                  systems.

                  from the present like a comet's tail, and that if we are to be
                  alive at all, here is the place to be?”
